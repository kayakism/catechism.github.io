    <marquee bgcolor="white" width="100%" scrolldelay="4">What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I
      walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.
      In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your
      enumerations!
      What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados,
      babies in the tomatoes!â€”and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?

      I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the
      grocery boys.
      I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?
      I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store
      detective.
      We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen
      delicacy, and never passing the cashier.

      Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?
      (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)
      Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll
      both be lonely.
      Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent
      cottage?
      Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his
      ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?

        <text>I'm maybe a bit delusional to think I can participate in society and not be apart of the rat race. I'll
          keep working on that. Did you know that up to 15% of the US population took amphetamines in the
          1960s?</text><br>

        <text>My friends and I were chased down by a crackhead on Tuesday. I wonder what he wanted to talk to us about.</text><br>

        <text>All I pray for is the happiness of those who try and realization for those that don't. Or a frontal lobotomy. That works, too.</text><br>

        <text>I refuse to allow the scrambling, desperate masses of unhappy unfortunates to ruin my renewed appreciation for living. What is it about their lack of self-awarness and unhappiness that compels them to make the rest of the world as miserable as they are through acts of cruelty or apathy? Some people simply don't deserve the power that comes with being human.</text><br>

        <text>I think of a cabin somewhere, covered in earth and leaves. Books, a fire, a pottery kiln, an old-fashioned door, a tabby on a floral tapestry couch with a quilt, illustrations in the style of medieval liturgical texts on the walls. My friends and anybody else who cared to could come and sit with me. The smell of coffee and the rose perfume she gave me, and the sound of ducks in the pond. In perfect isolation here behind my home, I'd wait for the worms to come.</text><br>

        <text>Allowing space for your child to make their own decisions in life is a parenting technique that is not suited for the internet age. I await the destruction of the internet by nuclear war with joyful anticipation.</text><br>

        <text>It's been a very long time since I spent my time in front of that old CRT TV with the VHS tape player. Do you ever miss the feeling of feeling things as strongly as you did back then? Bowie's gone now, but I can keep watching Labyrinth like he was still here. It was really the idea of Bowie that was so attractive, though the man himself was surely nice enough. But I didn't know him like I knew him through that old tape.</text><br>

        <text>Time it was, and what a time it was, it was. A time of innocence, a time of confidences. Long ago it must be... I have a photograph. Preserve your memories, they're all that's left you.</text><br>

        <text>Nowadays I think of the car rides, the movies on the couch, and the weekend trips to the farmer's market. It was always Sinatra Sundays on the radio, we'd drive past that carniceria on Victory. Everybody always thought you were my older brother. You asked one day what kind of music I listen to these days, and I told you about Radiohead, Nirvana, and Nine Inch Nails. So we listened to them in the car together. In Rainbows was your favorite album, and mine as well. I forgot you had me when you were that young, dad. I love you very much.</text><br>

        <text>Somebody on the bus smelled like my mother, with that mix of cigarette smoke and fruity perfume, maybe mingled with some confusing incense. All smoke and something nice. Remembered that I drew a picture of her when I was a kid, with her next to a full ashtray. She was proud and hung it on the fridge. It was in the house where we stared into the trees, watched for lights in the backyard and I stayed up too late watching gore horror.</text><br>
