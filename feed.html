    <marquee bgcolor="white" width="100%" scrolldelay="4">What thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, for I
      walked down the sidestreets under the trees with a headache self-conscious looking at the full moon.
      In my hungry fatigue, and shopping for images, I went into the neon fruit supermarket, dreaming of your
      enumerations!
      What peaches and what penumbras! Whole families shopping at night! Aisles full of husbands! Wives in the avocados,
      babies in the tomatoes!—and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?

      I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the
      grocery boys.
      I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?
      I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store
      detective.
      We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen
      delicacy, and never passing the cashier.

      Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way does your beard point tonight?
      (I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feel absurd.)
      Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll
      both be lonely.
      Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent
      cottage?
      Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did you have when Charon quit poling his
      ferry and you got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?

        <li>But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed
          looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't
          want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had noticed in the background earlier, he held
          firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as
          he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling
          slightly unwell, she brought a chair and asked, "Would you not like to sit down?" K. sat down immediately and,
          in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests. "You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?"
          she asked him. Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression that many young women
          have just when they're in the bloom of their youth. "It's nothing for you to worry about," she said, "that's
          nothing unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time they come here. This is your
          first time is it. Yes, it's nothing unusual then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the
          air so thick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices, whatever other advantages it might
          offer. But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's almost
          every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put out to dry here as well—and we can't stop the
          tenants doing that—it's not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air alright in the
          end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you
          feeling any better now?" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these people
          by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse.
          The girl noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a window pole that was leaning
          against the wall and pushed open a small hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much
          soot fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the soot off K.'s hands with her
          handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do that for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was
          until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made about him the sooner that would be. But
          then the girl said, "You can't stay here, we're in people's way here...." K. looked at her as if to ask whose
          way they were impeding. "If you like, I can take you to the sick room," and turning to the man in the doorway
          said, "please help me." The man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick room,
          that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from place to place, the further he went the more
          difficult it must become. So he said, "I am able to walk now," and stood up, shaking after becoming used to
          sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay upright. "I can't manage it," he said shaking his head,
          and sat down again with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything, would have been able to lead
          him out of there but who seemed to have gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman
          who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. "I think," said the man, who was elegantly
          dressed and whose appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long, sharply
          tailored points, "the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what
          he would most prefer, would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices altogether."
          "That's right," exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying, "I'm sure
          that'll make me feel better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little support under my
          arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit
          on the stairs for a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at all, I'm surprised at
          it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong,
          you've said so yourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm feeling dizzy, you see,
          and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself." And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for
          the two of them to take him by the arms.</li>
